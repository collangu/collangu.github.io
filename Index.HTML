        <p1> Similar to a crocodile but with fins instead of hands and much longer.<br> The currently extinct deep-sea marine lizard Mosasaur is truly a terrifying creture, up to 40f long and with teeth almost 6 inches long.<br>  It swims at incredible speeds to catch pray, and bites with a force almost over 6500 kilograms.<br> </p1>

        Mosasaur were armed with large, teeth-filled maws that alowed them to eat their prey hole, they were carnivorous creatures that fed on ammonties, by biting through their shellls with their powerful teeth.<br>
    
       They had round, blunt teeth, that were perfect for crushing through the shells of ammonites. They also ate any other meat they came across, including prehistoric sharks, birds, Plesiosaurs and other mosasaurs.

        Mosasaur fossils have been found all over the world in places like Sweden, France, Germany, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. They lived in deep oceans and stayed  in the depths to catch unsupecting prey.  <br>They stayed away from shallower water as, they were too big to fit in it, <br>but this does mean that prey can escape if it is fast enough.<br>

              Despite their resemlance to crocodiles, these creatures actually breathed air and gave birth to live young. <br> They spent their first years out in the open seas. <br>But not much is known about them, so we dont know if they provide care to their young. <br> All we know is that they grow up, give birth to more and repeat the unknown cycle again.
